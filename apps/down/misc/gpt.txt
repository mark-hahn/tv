## current setup

- currently i have 3 servers running in pm2 on a remote linux server. all are nodejs. there is a fourth vue/vite web-based project being hosted that server. the vue/vite project calls endpoints on those 3 servers and apis from other web apis.

## monorepo concerns

- each of 3 servers and the vite/vue project currently have their own git repos at github.

- if they are joined as monorepo would there need to be one new git github for all packages or could they stay separate?

- if all were merged into one monorepo could i go back in git history to old commits in separate old github repos?
