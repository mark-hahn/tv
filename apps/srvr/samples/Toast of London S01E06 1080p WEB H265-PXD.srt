1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,474
The new TS4 -
it's the car that literally goes...

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,752
"Vuh-roo-mmm-uh!"

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,758
That was great. Oh, actually, Steven,
before you shoot off,

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,597
there's a little thing that's just
come in. Do you mind?

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,356
What is it?

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,630
Hi, Steven, this is Clem Fandango.
Can you hear me?

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,636
Yes, I can hear you, Clem Fandango.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,274
We'd like you to do this charity thing
for the radio. Won't take a second.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,151
The script's in front of you, sir.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,714
Yeah, OK, I've got it. Are we rolling?

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,352
Yeah, ready when you are, Steven.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,518
Don't miss your opportunity
to experience Bon Ja-Vee

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,597
live, up close and personal.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,234
OK? You've got to understand,
I haven't a clue what that means.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,795
I mean, I'm guessing it's the name
of some kind of pop group or dance craze?

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,955
Spot-on, Steven.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,595
Also, the bit underneath,
Steven, when you're ready.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,555
Where else could you see
Bon Ja-Vee, Madame Ga-Gah...

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,272
...and The Cold Play

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,914
under one roof?

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,316
Oh, that's perfect.
See you again soon, yeah?

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,352
- I sincerely hope not.
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,994
What the hell happened to Roy Highknock?

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,350
Oh! Tsk! I'm afraid I had to
take his picture off the wall.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,753
- What, because of the...
- Yes, because of the...

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,995
Anyway, pastures new.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,952
Ooh. Who's Sookie Houseboat?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,433
Oh, she's come over from Debbie.

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,392
I knew I'd get her in the end. Things
just weren't working out for her there.

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,589
I know how she feels.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,950
Sookie Houseboat,
I could do with a slice of that.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,230
I haven't had as much as a sniff
since you-know-who cleared off.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,078
I could get stuck into that,
and no danger!

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,439
Toast! Please!

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,951
Sorry, Jane. Must be the hot weather.
Plays havoc with my blood pressure.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,719
I've no interest in your carnal rumblings.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,228
My brother Blair calls it
"the summer swell".

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,919
They seem to be wearing
a lot less this season.

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,520
You know, I had to loosen my belt
on the underground train...

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,075
If you carry on I will be sick.
No, I <i>will</i> be sick.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,314
- So, what's going on?
- Ooh! <i>Doctor Who</i>.

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,876
You can fuck that sky-high.
Huh! Not after last time. No way.

43
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,630
Well, that's no way to greet a fellow
scientist. Would you like a jelly baby?

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,593
We grow weary
of your adolescent diversions, Doctor!

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,790
Take him to the laboratory!

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,992
I'm sure a dissection on that brain
could prove very useful to us!

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,792
Yes!

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,674
I could have been anyone in that mask.
I felt like a top arsehole.

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,188
Right, well, that is it.

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,993
I'm not too happy at the moment, Jane.

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,508
I feel like I'm in a bit of a rut here.

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,357
Maybe I should broaden
my horizons a little.

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,633
Well, the thing is, Toast,
you don't actually have any horizons.

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,672
<i>Well, that may be</i>
<i>what you think, Jane Plough,</i>

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,553
<i>but there's a lot more to Steven Toast</i>
<i>than meets the eye</i>.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,352
It's pronounced "Pluff"',
as you well know,

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,833
as in Brian Clough the sportsman.

58
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,555
<i>That's odd. She seemed</i>
<i>to be able to read my thoughts there</i>.

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,909
Now bugger off, Toast.
Some of us are working.

60
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,276
Now.

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,476
Oh, morning, Toast. You're up early.
Oh, who's that boy?

62
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,511
Not one of yours, hm?
You don't have children.

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,755
Apparently, it's Brooklyn Beckham.

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,869
Brooklyn Beckham?

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,115
- What, Becks and Posh Spice's eldest?
- Yes.

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,720
I downloaded the image
accidentally about a month ago

67
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,512
and I can't get it off the screen.

68
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,870
Oh, I can probably help you with that.
Let's see.

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,353
Get rid of that.

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,879
Ed...!

71
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,878
- That should get... Followed by...
- Garlic.

72
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,798
And there we are.

73
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,595
Oh, what's that file?
<i>Another Wife For Henry</i> by Paloma Toast.

74
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,551
It's my new novel, Ed.

75
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,352
Using a nom de plume, eh?

76
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,435
I've been working on it for some weeks.

77
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,869
I'm just pissed off
with all those voice-overs

78
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,273
and appearing in that shit play.

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,313
I'm even thinking about getting a new
agent. Do you know Brooke Hooberman?

80
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,759
Yes, I've heard of her.

81
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,438
David Bowie told me he was
thinking of signing up with her

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,232
when he was doing
<i>The Elephant Man</i> on Broadway,

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,633
but he just went back
into the pop scene.

84
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,559
Well, she's a hard-nosed
American female bastard,

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,079
and that's exactly what I need,

86
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,315
and she's in town
and she's agreed to meet me.

87
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,590
So, this novel.

88
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,914
Sexy, is it?

89
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,949
I'd say!

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,709
It's a cross between Hilary Mantel's
<i>Wolf Hall</i> and <i>Fifty Shades Of Grey</i>.

91
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,749
Oh, I've read <i>Fifty Shades</i>.

92
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,916
I must say it's damn near
my favourite book of all time.

93
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,313
It's superb.

94
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,397
Unlike that book,
my heroine is a strong-willed feminist

95
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,998
who won't be dominated by anyone.

96
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,234
So, what's the story about?

97
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,316
- Well, I can read you some if you like.
- Oh, yes, please.

98
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,956
"Henry The Eight placed
his toothbrush beside Stephanie's,

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,313
"his a dashing royal blue,
hers a luminous pink.

100
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,510
"How harmonious they looked together

101
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,998
"in the silver goblet he had given her
for Valentine's Day 1541.

102
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,476
"'Oh, if only we could live together,'
he thought,

103
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,988
"remembering the time
they made love in the shed

104
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,511
"where the bows and arrows were stored
for the archery tournaments... sss!"

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,232
So, how does it end?

106
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,874
Well, I was thinking...

107
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,388
that it may not need an end.

108
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,238
Oh. I don't think I've ever
read a book without an end.

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,794
I'm experimenting
with a new literary form.

110
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,559
So, what are you going to do with it?
Send it out to potential publishers?

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,589
Already done.

112
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,598
And the fact that it doesn't have an end,
I think, will work in my favour.

113
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,790
I am <i>very</i> excited about this.

114
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,193
Any replies from the publishers?

115
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,550
None. But I'm hoping Hooberman
will give it a good push.

116
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,909
Good for you, Toast!
Things are picking up at last.

117
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,952
I think they are, Ed, and I'm going
to tell her that I see myself...

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,956
...very much at the peak of my career!

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,390
I can honestly say
I've never acted better in my life!

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,638
There's always openings
in Hollywood for British actors,

121
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,514
butlers and chauffeurs
and that kind of shit.

122
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,879
That's what I like to hear.

123
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,913
Sorry about having to meet you in a car.

124
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,837
My office isn't quite ready yet.

125
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,476
I'm also about to embark on
a complementary career as a novelist.

126
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,118
I understand you have strong contacts
in the literary world.

127
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,871
I do actually know a publisher
called Yvonne Wryly.

128
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,480
Had a bit of a nervous breakdown
due to overwork.

129
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,953
But she's back.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,436
If she likes a book,
she really gets behind it.

131
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,072
Does this mean
you're taking me on as a client?

132
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,873
Do you have representation at the moment?

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,354
I'm with someone who's basically
as old as the pyramids

134
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,277
and as dynamic as a weather forecast.

135
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,515
Sorry.

136
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,358
It's an old friend of mine.

137
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,994
Jane Plough. Do you know her?

138
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,193
And if I'm honest,
it was bloody embarrassing.

139
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,231
But she said she wouldn't tell Jane.

140
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,555
- Who is Jane again?
- Jane is my agent.

141
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,318
So, you're some kind of actor?

142
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,079
I'm not a kind of actor. I <i>am</i> an actor.

143
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,714
Sorry, my name's Toast, Steven Toast.

144
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,116
Hello, Toast. I'm Kate. Kate Khan.

145
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,593
- Kate?
- Mm.

146
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,518
Kate's in my top 20
of favourite female names.

147
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,710
Number 18, actually.

148
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,069
- I love a sing-along. Don't you?
- Yes.

149
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,271
- Why don't you have a go?
- No, I don't normally sing.

150
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,596
Though there is one song
I am told I perform particularly well.

151
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,679
Sing it! Go on! Get me a drink
and then sing the song.

152
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,439
- What will you have?
- Vodka and Coke.

153
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,870
Lan, could you get the lady
a vodka and Coke, please?

154
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,438
#... You so... #

155
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,552
I'd like to dedicate
this next song

156
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,876
to a beautiful lady in the audience
called Kate.

157
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,673
This is an old song about London.

158
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,429
# This town is coming like a ghost town!

159
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,031
# Bands don't play no more!

160
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,991
# Too much fightin' on the dance floor!

161
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,558
# This town is coming like a ghost town!

162
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,149
# Bands don't play no more!

163
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,509
# Too much fightin' on the dance floor!

164
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,915
# Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah!

165
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,520
# Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah!

166
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,351

Hop it, old-timer.

168
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,596
Steven, this is my aunt, Deepa.

169
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,154
Ah, nice to meet you.

170
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,792
- Hope you don't mind if she sits there.
- No.

171
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,673
I enjoyed that. It was unusual.

172
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,790
Well, it's another string to my bow.

173
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,796
What's the deal with your aunt?

174
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,957
Oh, she likes these nights out.
Unfortunately, she's deaf and blind.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,036
Also has a slight limp.

176
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,069
My mother usually cares for her,

177
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,795
but one month every year I, er... come to
London and give Mum a bit of a break.

178
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,752
So, she's deaf, blind
and with a bit of a limp.

179
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,916
Something of a fiasco, one might say.

180
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,349
- Would you like to go to a club?
- A club?

181
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,992
Yeah, there's a club I go to around here.
Do you like dancing?

182
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,679
- Of course.
- Come on. Let's have some fun.

No, I told you she's deaf and blind.

It's a little odd, though, isn't it?

Why? She doesn't know what's going on.

201
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,948
Does she have to be in the bedroom?

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,036
Yes! I can keep an eye on her here

203
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,150
and, honestly,
she's completely oblivious to this.

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,313
Wow.

212
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,793
What?

213
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,070
- What a book!
- Oh, thank you.

214
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,716
It's seriously one of the best things
I have ever read.

215
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,796
I think it's actually much sexier
than <i>Fifty Shades</i>

216
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,717
and just much better
than any of Mantel's books.

217
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,320
I mean, I love Hilary.
She's one of my best friends.

218
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,750
But can she write
strong female characters?

219
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,597
I don't think so.

220
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,676
But you've created

221
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,793
this incredible, strong-willed,
believable, independent woman.

222
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,319
She's amazing!

223
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,476
And you're not concerned she's
a columnist with a left-wing newspaper?

224
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,430
Not in the slightest.

225
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,234
OK, they probably didn't have newspapers
like the <i>Guardian</i> in the 16th century,

226
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,872
and they didn't have
columnists like Stephanie.

227
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,831
That's her name, isn't it?

228
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,110
- Yes. Stephanie de Swasson.
- But who cares?

229
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,355
We just kind of go with it
cos the character is so brilliant.

230
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,995
She doesn't take any shit
from Henry The Eight.

231
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,068
Totally in control of that situation
and obviously the dominant sexual partner.

232
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,634
Yeah, well, that was very important for me
when I was writing it.

233
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,238
Well, we're so excited about this here.

234
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,236
We've just put this together.

235
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,031
Where the hell did you find
that photograph of me?

236
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,799
Oh, it's a collage portrait
put together by the art department.

237
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,436
First, I should say, it's not right.
We can do much better.

238
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,438
- But the size is correct.
- No.

239
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,909
But this...
this is the most important part.

240
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,599
Major ads in all the trade papers.

241
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,473
Heavy TV and cinema advertising.

242
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,830
We are really gonna sell this book
because we believe in it so much.

243
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,318
I can see this being, quite seriously,
the biggest book of all time.

244
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,956
And I hate hyperbole, I hate all
that bullshit, and I see it all the time,

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,752
but this book really is that good.

246
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,633
Oh, I'm glad you like it as much as I do.

247
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,796
Publicity are planning
a massive celebratory lunch.

248
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,638
There's a possibility
we can get Obama along to it.

249
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,352
Oh, top-notch!

250
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,789
Can I ask you, Steven,
do you have a wife or partner?

251
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,432
Well, I'm having sex with an Indian lady,
which is great,

252
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,519
but it is complicated
by the presence of a third party.

253
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,199
Because we can organise getting
an A-list Hollywood actress along

254
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,559
to accompany you on the day.

255
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,794
Yes, I'd like that very much.

256
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,196
I'll contact Brooke
about the sums involved here.

257
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,753
Obviously, we're talking millions.

258
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,518
But I don't want to even
discuss that with you now,

259
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,357
because the book isn't quite finished.

260
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,198
- Erm...
- It needs an end.

261
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,470
Well, I was thinking I could get away
without having an end.

262
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,910
No, no. Absolutely not.
Who told you that? Ben Elton?

263
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,871
- Who?
- Having an end is very important.

264
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,070
We need to know what happens to Stephanie.

265
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,156
But don't worry.

266
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,988
You could tie up the whole thing in a few
paragraphs, maybe even a sentence or two.

267
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,314
But it does need an end.

268
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,112
All right. I'll try and think of one.

269
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,791
And thank you, Steven,
for writing the greatest book of all time.

270
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,708
Yes-sss!

Oh, come on, Toast.
She's just playing with her phone.

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,877
I told you she can't hear or see anything.

287
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,436
Well, if she's deaf and blind,
why does she need an camera phone?

288
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,278
Oh, get real, Toast.
Every phone has a camera these days.

289
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,880
Oh. Oh, that was lovely.

290
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,993
Excuse me for a moment.
I need to go to the bathroom.

291
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,708
I wonder if you really can't see or hear.

292
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,108
Hey!

293
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,997

What you doing to Aunt Deepa?

303
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,790
Ah, still working on the novel, Toast?

304
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,717
It must be nearly finished
if you don't need an end.

305
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,035
Well, looks like
it may need an end after all.

306
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,877
Publisher lady thinks it's crucial.

307
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,390
What happens to Stephanie de Swasson?
It's a tough nut to crack.

308
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,035
I'm sure it's easy enough to think
of an end. You could kill everyone.

309
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,753
I need to get out of here.

310
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,950
- Clear my head.
- Good thinking, Toast.

311
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,560
I'm sure you'll definitely, definitely
be able to think of something.

312

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,637
All this not hearing and seeing stuff,
total bullshit. Am I right?

335
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,557
Look, I <i>was</i> deaf and blind,

336
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,469
but last year I went to the holy temple
in India and received a miracle cure.

337
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,035
I didn't tell anyone
cos I didn't want to lose my benefits.

338
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,069
So, you're a benefits cheat.

339
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,997
You know, it's because of people like you

340
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,828
that the membership of the UK
Independence Party has gone up 12-fold!

341
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,949
Don't tell everyone!

342
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,560
Oh, I will, I will. In fact...

343
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,999
Officer!

344
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,793
Stop that woman! She's a benefits cheat!

345
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,114

- I've got it, Ed.
- What?

361
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,880
An end. I've got the end to my novel.

362
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,194
I see. Oh, well done.

363
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,516
It's truly inspired.
I'm very pleased with it.

364
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,314
Come on, then. Do tell. What happens to
the fair and feisty Stephanie de Swasson?

365
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,430
Spontaneous combustion.

366
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,313
- Spontaneous combustion?
- Yes.

367
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,874
Stephanie de Swasson
spontaneously combusts?

368
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,992
You must be fucking joking!

369
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,395
It's a ridiculous cop-out.

370
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,193
Is the end of <i>Moby-Dick, The Whale,</i>
spontaneously combusting?

371
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,198
- Did JK Rowling have Harry Potter...
- Who?

372
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,390
...bursting into flames
to tie up her series

373
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,159
of seven hugely successful novels?

374
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,431
People can spontaneously combust.
It's on the Internet.

375
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,311
- No, they can't!
- Yes, they can.

376
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,557
Though rare, there have been
exactly 200 documented cases.

377
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,239
It's totally unbelievable!

378
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,794
To think I offered you
the sun, moon and stars,

379
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,718
and this is the best ending
you can think of!

380
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,079
I had a nervous breakdown,

381
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,033
and I come back to work after six months
and have to deal with this shit!

382
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,393
And I tell you something else,
you little prick, if I ever...

383
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,435
Well, that's not gonna help my book.

384
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,189
She was just saying how completely
unbelievable it would be

385
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,196
for someone to spontaneously combust,

386
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,276
and then, "Bang!"

387
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,394
I mean, it was the definition of irony.
Irony writ very large.

388
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,637
Yes, I guess we'll never know
what causes spontaneous combustion.

389
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,874
It's one of the great mysteries.

390
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,117
- Like the moon landings.
- Excuse me.

391
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,389
Toast.

392
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,873
<i>Frinkbuster says he'll meet youl</i>

393
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,717
- Well, that is promising.
- <i>He'll meet you in an hotel</i>.

394
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,749
All the best.

395
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,075
- Who was that, Toast?
- Brooke Hooberman.

396
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,795
Apparently, a Hollywood film producer
called Dinky Frinkbuster wants to meet.

397
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,479
Hollywood producer, eh?
Oh, that's impressive.

398
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,715
Must be staying somewhere
like Claridge's or the Dorchester.

399
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,318
I expect so.

400
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,996
Make yourself comfortable, Toast.

401
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,759
- You want a banana?
- No, I'm good.

402
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,677
So, what's this movie about, Frinkbuster?

403
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,280
Well, it's about a couple
of lesbian lovers, right?

404
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,550
And they get kind of bored of lesbian sex,

405
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,431
so one goes out
with this big black bodybuilder.

406
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,311
The other one stays at home
lying in the sun

407
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,319
until a hunky British guy comes by
to clean out the pool.

408
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,749
OK. So, I... I need to get
the overall picture.

409
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,119
What would you say
the theme of the film is?

410
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,639
What do you mean, theme?

411
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,478
- So I'm playing the British pool cleaner.
- Yeah.

412
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,999
So, what's my relationship with the girl?

413
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,871
What...

414
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,029
Well, you just fuck her.

415
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,914
Well, that sounds
like it could be a porn film.

416
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,110
- Look, I've seen your work.
- What?

417
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,388
I hope we're not at cross-purposes here.

418
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,757
<i>Oohl This is great sexl</i>

419
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,075
<i>Absolutely superb stuffl</i>

420
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,156
<i>Oh, you're certainly delivering</i>
<i>the goods today, Toastl</i>

421
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,918
<i>That's cos I'm in a good moodl</i>

422
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,394
- Haven't you seen that?
- That's outrageous!

423
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,555
Got half a million hits.

424
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,434
That Indian lady with the sunglasses
is not a professional film-maker.

425
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,517
- She's a benefits fraudster.
- Well, suit yourself.

426
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,271
Hold your horses. Don't turn it off.

427
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,311
- <i>Yesl</i>
- <i>Oh, come on, Toastl</i>

428
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,918
<i>Yesl</i>

429
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,791
- <i>Oohl</i>
- How many hits?

430
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,398
- Half a mill.
- Is that good?

431
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,795
You're a superstar.

432
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,831
<i>- Lucky youl</i>
- KATE: <i>Lucky mel</i>

433
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,394
- You are lucky!
<i>- Come on, give it to mel Ohl</i>

434
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,908
She sure is.

435
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,633
Toast... you fucking snake!

436
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,639
Going behind my back
with all that secret squirrel stuff.

437
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,234
Sit up straight when I'm talking to you!

438
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,113
- I asked her not to tell you.
- Brooke and I are very old friends.

439
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,469
Course she's going to tell me if one
of my clients is trying to jump ship.

440
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,078
You fucking idiot.

441
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,078
- Well, nothing materialised.
- Shh.

442
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,398
You do have some ridiculous ideas,
don't you? Hollywood films, novel writing.

443
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,955
I'm this close to taking
your picture off my wall.

444
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,829
Oh, come on, Jane.

445
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,759
I shall think about this tonight and
let you know my decision in the morning.

446
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,837
You'll be needed in the studio
at ten o'clock.

447
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,909
Bzzz.

448
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,794
Bzzz.

449
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,479
Bzzz.

450
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,711
Bzzz.

451
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:46,197
Look, I'm gonna need some direction.
Which bee am I meant to be?
