His ex-girlfriend Áine has just found a new boyfriend, and Frank may be finding that a tad difficult. Luckily, Frank has a loyal best friend, Doofus, whose full-time job is clearing the debris left in Frank’s wake.

Back in the 1980s, he branched out into television production, writing and starring in a series so radical, so scary and so downright crazy that when the bosses of Channel 4 saw what they had on their hands, they ran away screaming, like little girls. Only now, twenty years on and amid the worst programming drought in television history, have the station finally allowed the show on the air. Intercut with new interviews with Marenghi himself and his co-stars Dean Learner and Todd Rivers, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace is perhaps the most disturbing vision of hospital life ever broadcast.","firstAired":"2004-01-29","lastAired":"2004-03-04","averageRuntime":25,"originalCountry":"gbr","originalLanguage":"eng","status":"Ended","remotes":[{"name":"IMDB (8.5)","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397150","ratings":"8.5"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Marenghi%27s_Darkplace"},{"name":"Google","url":"https://www.google.com/search?q=Garth%20Marenghi's%20Darkplace%20tv%20show"}],"saved":1756500254551,"showId":"noemby-0.9978505468183207","deleted":"2025-02-12","added":"2024-07-25"},"A Gentleman in Moscow":{"tvdbId":"417619","name":"A Gentleman in Moscow","originalNetwork":"Paramount+","seasonCount":1,"episodeCount":8,"watchedCount":8,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/417619/posters/65cd6bc059293.jpg","score":19490,"overview":"In 1922, Count Rostov finds himself stuck in Moscow and on the wrong side of history.

Ray is passionate about protest, ludicrously enthusiastic about every hip trend and convinced he is (or could be) a major player in the battle between the Establishment and the alternative society. Alex - though he comes from a wealthy background and seems more interested in golf than altering society - is coolness personified, a man so laid-back he seems to exist outside of reality. Jill embraces all the new-found liberty afforded her gender and claims to espouse free love, though this attitude doesn't stretch to her 'boyfriend', Ray, long been deprived of her carnal interest. Hugo is spectacularly vague, almost brilliant in his obliqueness. Led by Ray, the quartet jump on every trendy bandwagon and comprehensively fail to make the slightest bit of difference in all they do. The gang are pretty useless at everything - in fact, they're not even that good at being hippies.","firstAired":"1999-11-12","lastAired":"1999-12-17","averageRuntime":30,"originalCountry":"gbr","originalLanguage":"eng","status":"Ended","remotes":[{"name":"IMDB (7.0)","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187646","ratings":"7.0"},{"name":"Google","url":"https://www.google.com/search?q=Hippies%20tv%20show"}],"saved":1756484714123,"deleted":"2025-01-21","added":"2024-08-23"},"History of the World, Part II":{"tvdbId":"412421","name":"History of the World, Part II","originalNetwork":"Hulu","seasonCount":1,"episodeCount":8,"watchedCount":8,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/412421/posters/6415379761dc4.jpg","score":10279,"overview":"After waiting over 40 years there is finally a sequel to the seminal Mel Brooks film, History of the World, Part I, with each episode featuring a variety of sketches that take us through different periods of human history.","firstAired":"2023-03-06","lastAired":"2023-03-09","averageRuntime":26,"originalCountry":"usa","originalLanguage":"eng","status":"Ended","remotes":[{"name":"IMDB (5.6)","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15715052","ratings":"5.6"},{"name":"Official Website","url":"https://www.hulu.com/series/history-of-the-world-part-ii-6c9bcf68-0c93-497a-aa4f-d5215faa9860"},{"name":"Google","url":"https://www.google.com/search?q=History%20of%20the%20World,%20Part%20II%20tv%20show"}],"saved":1756484834127,"deleted":"2025-01-21","added":"2024-08-24"},"Hitmen":{"tvdbId":"353283","name":"Hitmen","originalNetwork":"Sky One","seasonCount":2,"episodeCount":12,"watchedCount":12,"image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/series/353283/posters/5f197710e51e9.jpg","score":2832,"overview":"Having stumbled into a career in contract killing, misfits Fran and Jamie are not your typical killers for hire.

It centers on Mike Flaherty, the deputy mayor, who has to protect the slightly moronic mayor, Randall Winston from those who want to ruin his political career, and from himself, cause he is constantly making an ass of himself and Mike has to try and make sure that his little escapades are either not made public or have very little negative effect on the mayor. Helping Mike is Carter, probably the least quirky member of the mayor's staff and Nikki and James. Stuart and Paul are two members of the staff who cause just as much problems. Mike's secretary, who joined the show during the second season was Stacy. Mike's girlfriend during the first season was Ashley, but the character was dropped, his next girlfriend, during the following season was Laurie, and during the third season it was Nikki, and in the fourth season it was Caitlin Moore, the mayor's campaign manager. Michael J. Fox would leave the show after the fourth season. During the next season, the new deputy mayor would be Charlie Crawford.","firstAired":"1996-09-17","lastAired":"2002-04-30","averageRuntime":25,"originalCountry":"usa","originalLanguage":"eng","status":"Ended","remotes":[{"name":"Emby","url":"https://hahnca.com:8920/web/index.html#!/item?id=4822972&serverId=ae3349983dbe45d9aa1d317a7753483e"},{"name":"Rotten (68/0)","url":"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/spin_city","ratings":"68/0"},{"name":"Google","url":"https://www.google.com/search?q=Spin%20City%20tv%20show"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_City"},{"name":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/qaxkzw/spin_city_is_one_of_the_funniest_tv_shows_but_it/"},{"name":"IMDB (7.3)","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115369","ratings":"7.3"}],"characters":[{"character":"Angie Ordonez","actor":"Lana Parrilla","image":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/person/356096/5eaf05afe5611.jpg","tvdbUrl":"https://thetvdb.com/people/356096-lana-parrilla","sortOrder":13,"isFeatured":false},{"character":"Mike Flaherty","actor":"Michael J.
