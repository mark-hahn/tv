write node script to read data/tvdb.json and parse the json. then step through the 258 entry objects inside the outermost object.  an entry object has a key like the first "Acapulco (2021)". step through the elements in reverse order.  in each elemnt add a field call dateCreated that has a date string like "2025-09-17". in the last element (first scanned) add the date "2025-10-26".  then as you go backward decrement that date by one day each element and save that date. After all stepped/scanned write the JSON.stringified data as the file data/tvdb-fixed.json.
