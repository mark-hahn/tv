write node script to read data/tvdb.json and parse the json. then step through the 258 entry objects inside the outermost object.  an entry object has a key like the first "Acapulco (2021)". step through the elements in reverse order. create a new single object where each element has the key of the entry object and a value of a date string like "2025-10-22". the last element (first scanned) should have the date "2025-10-22".  then as you go backward decrement that date by one day each element and use that date  as the value . After all stepped/scanned write the new object data as the file data/created.json.
