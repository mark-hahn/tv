- remove current behavior of clicking on file name

- when loading input box load path relative to /mnt/media/tv so /mnt/media/tv/xxx/yyy would be loaded as xxx/yyy whether it is a file or dir.

- when typing in a path and enter key is pressed or Load button is clicked append the input to /mnt/media/tv/. 

- when calling getfile(<arg>) use <arg> relative to /mnt/media/tv/.

- always sanitize <arg>. replace // with / etc.

- when a dir name is clicked and expanded, if the last child is below pane and not visible then scroll pane up such that the last child is at the bottom of the pane but not so far as to make dir name invisible above the top.  in other words the dir name should always be visible.

- when a file is clicked select it and highlight it in yellow. allow multiple selections using ctrl-click and range selection with shift-click. ctrl-clicks can select files in different dirs. when pane loads or tree root changes remove selections and highlights. children hidden when dir is collaped should have  selection removed.

- if white space to the right of a name is clicked then don't do normal name click, instead remove all selections.

- rename open button to "Load"

- add buttons "Open",  "Close", and  "Sel" to far right of hdr. dim "Sel" if no file is selected.

- if Open is clicked expand all dir nodes

- if Close is clicked close all dir nodes

- if Sel is clicked and only one file name is selected then parse the selected file name (title) with parse-torrent-title() to get series (show name) and select show in showList. this will load input box with showpath and reload tree.

- if dir name or unselected file name is ctrl-clicked then don't do default action, instead show "Is it OK to delete <path>." confirmation dialog and if confirmed then call srvr.deletePath(<path>) where <path> is complete path starting with /mnt/media/tv/ and ending with selected dirname or filename.

- if selected file name is ctrl-clicked then don't do default action, instead show confirmation dialog "Is it OK to delete <selected path>." where <selected path> is the file path if only one file is selected or "Is it OK to delete <sel count> files. " if multiple files are selected with <sel count> the number of files selected.  if deletion is confirmed then call srvr.deletePath(<path>) for each selected file path where <path> is complete path starting with /mnt/media/tv/ and ending with selected  filename.
