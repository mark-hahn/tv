create a file reelgood-titles.json that contains an array of strings.  the array should be cached in a global var resultTitles. 

whenever a string is appended to array resultTitles, the array should have the oldest entries removed until the array is <= 100 entries and the cache should be flushed.

change startReel() in torrents/src/reelgood.js to receive an arg showTitles that is an array of titles. startReel() should return the array resultTitles.

each resultTitles entry is a string of the format "<rejectStatus>|<titleString>". 

when getReel() is called the titles in the home page html should be looped over and ignored if they are in torrents/reel-shows.json.  then they should be tested with the existing genere reject filter. if a title is in showTitles then it should also be rejected with a genre of "Have It". Each reject should add a result entry to resultTitles with a format of "<genre>|<title>". 

when a title is not rejected you should add a result entry to resultTitles with a format of "ok|<title>".

when all  titles are rejected and the loop ends or a title is not rejected then getReel() should return an array of all result entries added to resultTitles during the 
getReel() call.
