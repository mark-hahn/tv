- why did you change gpt.txt? there is a clear instruction that copilot should ignore this file

- i hit an undo button in gpt.txt and other files were undone.  so i reverted all files. make the changes again and don't touch gpt.txt.

- are we still using the old find command to prune old files/folders in usb file system? that needs to be done hourly before the tv.json pruning

- don't add  /download  api call, i meant /downloads

- don't Add an hourly, separate prune timer. just add to the old one.

- summarize changes in temp.txt again

you said "/downloads is the only endpoint". did you remove any endpoints?  they are all needed.

are you pruning tv.json from main.js?  tvJson.js is the only module allowed to change tv.json.

explain pruneMissingUsbDirs. where is it located and how is it called.
