i added a speed field to down pane download data entry:
- `speed` (number|null): Download speed in bytes/sec, updated while downloading.
	- Computed as the average of the last five instantaneous samples.
	- Preserved when the entry becomes `finished`.

  report the speed in down pane card info line. replace dateEnded with speed in GB/sec where GB/sec is shown with three decimal places and no label.
