write a bash script called get-qbt-info at the project root. it should implement the functionality of misc/qb-info.js of accessing the qbttorrent api info.  it should write the result to misc/qb-info.json.

i will run this script from wsl and nothing should run in the windows enviornment.

it should use QB_HOST, QB_USER, and QB_PASS from torrents/cookies/qbt-cred.txt for host and credentials.

it should not use npm run and not use node.

if you want to add files then stop and ask me

exlain what you are going to do. make no changes for now.
