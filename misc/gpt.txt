the panes now scroll ok so everything shows -- but i want to shrink and move all the content to fit on this size of screen 

i only need to fix it for this one screen size on the tablet 

it would be nice if the entire series pane could be shrunk including everything like the image, buttons, text, etc.

the series pane could also be moved left making the list pane narrower

the button heights in buttons.view could be shorter to make buttons fit

this may be bad for my laptop sizing but we can worry about that later

could there be constants for everything that i could tweak?
