how is speed calculated and displayed in qbt pane card


- if there is an alt-click on down pane card and  isDevelopment is false and down card tv.json object contains the property procId 
then call startproc(<title>:<procId>)  
- call will return {"ok":true} or {"error":"<error msg>"}.

change startproc(<title>~~<procId>) to startproc("hyper.<procId>")
