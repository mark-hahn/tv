in beginning of addGapToShow after this line:       
const {showId, progress, notReady, anyWatched,
             watchGap, watchGapSeason, watchGapEpisode, 
             fileEndError, seasonWatchedThenNofile,
             fileGap,  fileGapSeason,  fileGapEpisode}
                          = event.data;
then if watchGap or fileGap are true then then call tvdb.getSeriesMap and if season 1 episode 1 in map is unaired then set FileGap and WatchGap to false before continuing


"Small Prophets"  is noemby so this gap logic won't  work for it --
