add a new choice "Notes" to #sortpop after "Ratings". it should sort the show list in  alphabetical order of show.Notes. shows with notes should be listed first

in simple mode add a button at bottom of the left-side list called "Notes Order".  is should sort the list in notes order just like the Notes sort option in non-simple mode.
