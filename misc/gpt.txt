=== copilot should ignore this file 
=== do not use this file for prompts
=== it is just a scratchpad for editing copilot prompts.

if window width is greater than window height (landscape) then keep the list and series panes side by side.  
if window height is greater than window width (portrait) then put series pane above the list pane with both the full width of the window.  Put a line the width of the pane between them that can be dragged.

in landscape mode the series pane is on left instead of right and dragging the vertical bar changes dimensions in wrong direction
