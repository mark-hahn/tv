=== do not use this file for prompts
=== it is just a scratchpad for editing copilot prompts.


the rpc calls now return an array property called "applied" that is a list of every file_id that was used to succesfully add a srt file or delete a srt file.

keep a running list of every file_id ever returned in localstorage. store the file_id as a number in the json string like [1,2], not a string.

in files cards show a small checkmark on every card with the file_id in that list.
 
keep the list in order of addition and whenever the list exceeds 1000 items prune oldest items to get it down to 1000.
