create module torrents/src/usb.js

it should implement the logic in the bash script get-qbt-info to query the qbittorrent api to return info. it should use the credential file torrents/cookies/qbt-cred.txt.

usb.js should export function getQbtInfo with no args and return an object from the returned json.

it should not use any env var or npm run script.  it should only be used by calls from the client to server.js.

add an endpoint from the client in server.js to run getQbtInfo and return the info to the client.

explain how you plan to do this and whether you need more information from me.  don't change anything yet.
