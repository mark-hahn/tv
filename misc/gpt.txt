remove torrent commands to remote server in srvr.js

change torrents.vue back to just getting torrents and showing them.  do not send them to remote server. there should be no reference to remote server.

when a torrent card is clicked call a function selTorrent in torrents/server.js with the torrent info. selTorrent should just log the info and return {"status":"ok"}.

from now on when i say server in the context of torrents I mean torrents/server.js.  We are not using the remote server anymore for torrents. all values sent to server and return values should be json.

create torrents/process.js. forward selTorrent commands to this file to be processed and returned.  more commands will be added later.

refactor torrent searching to torrents/search.js
