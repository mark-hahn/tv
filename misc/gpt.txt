=== copilot should ignore this file 
=== do not use this file for prompts
=== it is just a scratchpad for editing copilot prompts.

- do not read or write or revert misc/gpt.txt

- replace data/tv.json file and the cached version of it in memory with a sqlite db.

- you said "I’m going to inspect how tv.json is loaded/updated today (likely via tvJson.js), then replace that module".  do not replace any module.  

can't sql return the 200 sorted entries directly for /download  instead of loading all into memory?

what data is passed to pruneMissingUsbDirs?
