Torrents, Status, History, Series, and Map

add a new file history.vue -- it should show a pane like the series pane, map pane, etc.

it should have a sticky hdr with "History" on top left and buttons on the right.  buttons should be Torrents, Status, Series, and Map.

it should call getQbtInfo({}) (no filters) repeatedly like the status page does but it should update with 5 seconds between calls not one sec.

getQbtInfo({}) will return a large number of torrents. Show a card for every torrent like the status page. sort them by added_on with newest at top.

the cards will have only two lines, the title line, and below that the info line.

the info line will have values separated by commas with no names or suffixes.  

if prop state is "downloading" then the line template is:

 "<month>/<day>.<hour>:<min>, <size>, downloading, <progpc>%, <eta>",

<month>,<day>, <hour>, <min> are 2 digits each from prop added_on;
<size> is prop size in gigabytes with 1 decimal place;
<progpc> is (prop completed)/(prop size) as integer percent;
<eta> is prop eta in mins:secs
--
if prop state is not "downloading" then the line template is:

 "<month>/<day.<hour>:<min>, <hour2>:<min2>, <size>, finished"

<month>,<day>, <hour>, <min> are 2 digits each from prop added_on;
<hour2>, <min2> are 2 digits each from prop completion_on;
<size> is prop size in gigabytes with 1 decimal place;
