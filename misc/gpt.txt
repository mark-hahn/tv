=== copilot should ignore this file 
=== do not use this file for prompts or edit it
=== it is just a scratchpad for editing copilot prompts.

the reelgood-titles.json and its memory cache should never be Cleared. it should always be appended to with the only deletion being pruning.

load reelgood-titles into a memory cache at startup.  append as before and flush it every time it is appended to. before flushing prune the end to keep it less than 100 entries.

every time getreel is called the returned entries should be appended to the reelgood-titles cache except for errors or none-found entries.

startReel() should return all of reelgood-titles cache after it fetches the page.
