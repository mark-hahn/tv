i want a new tab with a pane connected. 

the tab should be "Reel" and placed between Actors and Tor.  

the pane should be the same size and position as series.vue. the pane should be the component src/components/reel.vue.

the pane should have to boxes side-by-side the full height called reelLeft on left and reelRight on right.

reelLeft contains a component called gallery in src/components/reel-gallery.vue. 

gallery is a scrolling pane of cards with each card showing an image and caption. each card matches an entry in an array of tvdb records returned from srchTvdbData(title) in src/tvdb.js. 

when the pane is loaded or whenever a property called srchStr changes, srchTvdbData() should be called with that property srchStr to get the list of tvdb records and show the cards. 

the file samples/sample-tvdbs/srchTvdbData.json has an example of a tvdb record. that record has a property image_url that is the url of the image for the card. the caption of the card is "<year> - <name>" where <year> is the property year in the record and <name> is the property name in the record.

reelRight has 4 panes stacked vertically.  They are the reelInfo, reelDescr, reelButtons, and reelTitles panes.
