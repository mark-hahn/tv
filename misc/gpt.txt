=== copilot should ignore this file 
=== do not use this file for prompts
=== it is just a scratchpad for editing copilot prompts.

my instructions were contradictoy when ctrl-clicking on file name - i said to add to selection and i also said to delete the file. ctrl-clicking on file name should add to selection.

for deletion of dir or file use alt-click, not ctrl-click


expanding selection with shift-click should expand to last file selected if in same dir, do nothing if no selection in dir and not clear any other selections

clicking on file name should toggle selection
