do not save homeHtml to disk. keep it globally available to getReel.

getReel should just use the saved homeHtml.

oldShows = loadReelShows() should only be called once at module loading.  oldShows should be cached and written back to disk only at end of getReel.

if any error return { status: 'error', errmsg: '<error msg>' };
