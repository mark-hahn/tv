- gap behavior in server has changed -- see misc/notes.txt.
- remove blockedWait and waiting property from all gap objects and gap processing and display logic.  waitStr is now the only property related to waiting.
- remove gap.WaitStr = await tvdb.getWaitStr(show); in addGapToShow and insert WaitStr into show object using tvdb.getWaitStr in loadallshows when merging tvdb data into shows.
