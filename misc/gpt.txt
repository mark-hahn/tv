remove all scrollbars in series and actors panes
--
i added id="showlineicons" to show.vue
--
adjust the offset and spacing of icons in #botrgt in #hdrbottom  to line up with the icons in #showlineicons

spacing in #botrgt doesn't match spacing in #showlineicons.  feel free to make #botrgt and #showlineicons fixed-width.

the spacing in #botrgt doesn't match spacing in #showlineicons so the alignment drifts

#botrgt and #showlineicons now align perfectly but they need some space on the right -- add 5px margin-right to #botrgt and #showlineicons

#botrgt moved left but #showlineicons didn't

remove scrollbars from #showsContainer

there is a 1px line on the right side of #shows and table in #shows.  is it a border?
