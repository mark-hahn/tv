nothing was working so i reverted it back to where right and bottom overlapped scrollbars.
--
try putting a div inside the pane with width and height small enough to fit inside scrollbars and then scrolling the table inside that div

i reverted again to the original version with the table under the scrollbars problem. 
-- 
remove the scrollbars and i'll move the table hoizontally with the arrows on top and vertically with the scroll wheel
