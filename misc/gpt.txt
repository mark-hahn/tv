in actors pane ..

- when season or episode input box is blurred then the guest actors for that season/episode should be refreshed

- remove Regulars/guests msg in top row of hdr.  in regular mode hilight the regular button in light-gray and  in guests mode hilight the guests button in light-gray 

- in Plebs show season 0 has only episode 1 (S00E01).  season 1 has 6 episodes"  when season input box is 0 and episode box is 1 then guests button works correctly but clicking on either arrow leaves season input box blank and episode still 1.

the regulars/guests buttons are not hilighted
