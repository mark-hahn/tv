sometimes the parsed torrent will have a group like:   "group": "HETeam",
-- when it doesn't extract group from raw title like EDGE2020:   "title": "3rd Rock from the Sun (1996) S01-S06 (1080p DVD AI UPSACLE x265 HEVC 10bit DD 2 0 EDGE2020)",

here are more examples:
TAoE from:   "title": "3rd Rock from the Sun (1996) S01-S06 (1080p AMZN Webrip x265 10bit EAC3 5 1 - TheSickle)[TAoE]",
SiGMA from:   "title": "3rd Rock From The Sun S01 1080p AMZN WEB-DL DD5 1 H 264-SiGMA",
MKV from:   "title": "3rd Rock from The Sun Complete MKV",
XViD from:  "title": "3rd Rock From The Sun Complete Series DVDRip XViD",
hqe from:  "title": "3rd Rock from the Sun Complete DVDRip x264-hqe",

-- put that group in parsed section of json
