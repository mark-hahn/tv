when i say qbt tab then that means the history.vue pane.
when i say down tab then that means the tvproc.vue pane.

whenever the qpt pane has loaded any cards set an array called activeDownLoads to contain the titles of all cards in downloading state.

on every poll check to see if any entry of activeDownLoads is not downloading. if so then send a startProc command to https://hahnca.com/tvproc/startProc.

after that check set activeDownLoads to have the titles of all cards downloading.
