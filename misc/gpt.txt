decisions ...

Store format should be json file with minimum flushes.

for detailUrlFromHash and hashFromFilePath include all suggested properties

use **exact containment** (usb absolute path == qbt root + relative file path), not fuzzy name matching.

don't need stronger identity

no debug fields for now

new requirement: 

when tv-proc gets filepath it should check the season folder for multiple video files that match parse-torrent-title on the one file provided by rpc call filepath. then map.vue should open all detail pages.

this means we will need to use multiple rpc results `{ ok:true, results:[…] }` 

put complete logic for all this with no more options in notes.txt.  if any decision is missing use your best suggestion.
