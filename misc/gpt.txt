the tvdb results have a field called "sort" for each actor. lets call that the actorSort.
then tmdb has the number of episode appearances for each actor. lets call that the actorEpiCount.
when running the merge/sort record whether the actor came from tvdb or tmdb in the output.

run the sort/merge and then sort the output list such that the tvdb actors appear before the tmdb actors. 
sort the tvdb actors by actorSort ascending.
sort the tmdb actors by actorEpiCount descending.
then display the output list
