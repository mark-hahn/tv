- when i refer to server i mean hahnca.com. you can ssh into hahnca.com without credentials

- i moved the project tv-proc from the server /root/dev/apps/tv-proc to tv-proc here

- adjust code references to tv-proc endpoints

- tv-proc should mirror how torrents is used.  there should be a tv-proc-server in pm2 in localhost and on server. 

- the release script should Deploy tv-proc server and Run tv-proc release steps on remote server just as it does for torrents server

- misc/server.conf is a copy of /etc/nginx/conf.d/server.conf on server. configure proxy endpoints for tv-proc as they are for torrents

- rename script srvr to srvt and create new script srvp that runs tv-proc-server like how srvt runs torrents-server
