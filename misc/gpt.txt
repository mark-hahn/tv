- move subs tab to between Down and Files

- when the pane is loaded before search button is pressed show "Press search to load subtitles." in center of pane.

- when the subs pane search button is pressed do a search using an imdb id from the selected show. use secrets/subs-token.txt. if you get a not logged in error then login using using secrets/subs-login.txt, write secrets/subs-token.txt, and try again.

- if the search results are empty (total_pages == 0) show "No subtitles found." in the center of the pane and do nothing else.

- load the entries from "data" property array into the array var "searchResults" that meet this citeria:
    data.type "subtitle",
    data.attributes.language "en",
    and data.attributes.feature_details.feature_type "Tvshow".

for each entry:
  if total_count is greater than per_page then load the rest of the pages.

- log the first entry of searchResults.

- populate the cards with data from searchResults. the format should be:

line 1: "S<season>E<episode> <data.attributes.release>"
line 2: "<5 spaces><data.attributes.uploader.name> <data.attributes.ai_translated> <data.attributes.machine_translated>"

where <season> and <episode> are from running parse-torrent-title on data.attributes.release.

skip any false valued field data.attributes.machine_translated or data.attributes.machine_translated.





remove proxy server for getSubsLoginPath and getSubsTokenPath in torrents/src/server.js. instead add them to the websocket calls to tv-series-srvr.
-- document everything copilot needs in tv-series-srvr to provide the endpoint for them.  i'll move secrets/subs-login.txt and secrets/subs-token.txt to tv-series-srvr.



to get them call use  "export function getSubsSecrets() {return fCall('getDevices')} in srvr.js to call getSubsSecrets.

when i searched Cheers show before i got the json in misc/subs-cheers.json. but using the new search button I got only these two:

S02E28 Cheers - S00E28 - Gag Reel - Bloopers from Season 2 Anonymous
S02E?? Cheers.S02.Bonus. MrLifestyles

what is blocking the others?

the home page opensubtitles.com Cheers search gave an imdb id tt0083399 which worked -- do we have that?

the samples/sample-shows/show.json has:
  "ExternalUrls": [
    {
      "Name": "IMDb",
      "Url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5511512"
    },

log the first entry that has episode S?? or E??


if that parse fails try using data.attributes.url.  if parse-torrent-title fails they looking for SxxEyy yourself.  

here is an example: "url": "https://www.opensubtitles.com/da/subtitles/cheers-s11e28-web", 

-- and if that fails try the same things on every entry in the array data.attributes.files with property file_name. an example of files is:         "files": [
          {
            "file_id": 9093146,
            "cd_number": 1,
            "file_name": "Cheers - S11E28 WEB.dan"
          }
        ]
