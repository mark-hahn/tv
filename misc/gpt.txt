how would i use playwright to find this and click on it

<div id="age-gate-agree">
            <a href="#" class="grated" title="I'm more than 18 years old!">Enter</a>
          </div>

explain with no changes

will this get page html resulting from click into grated.html:
    await page.goto(searchUrl);
    await page.click('#age-gate-agree a');
    const html = await page.content();

explain with no changes
