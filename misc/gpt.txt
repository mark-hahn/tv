- currently:  // After the hourly USB prune command is kicked off, prune tv.json entries whose USB folder no longer exists.

- this means some some tv.json entries will not be pruned when the folders will be pruned because the USB prune command is async.

- don't start pruning tv.json entries until USB prune command is finished.
