- the test script worked with a new direct url- the get button in tor pane did not work.

- in download.js make an endpoint that is given a search result from a provider, gets the torrent file, and returns it. only use direct url computed from search result fid and file. -- use same logic used in curl-test.js to get torrent file-- do not use any detail page

- change the tor pane get button to just do search, call that endpoint, and send send the torrent file returned to the usb server 

- do nothing with detail file except show it in a tab when old logic says to.
