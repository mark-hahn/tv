- add tv-series-srvr rpc offsetSubfiles(fileIdObjs) with a return of ok or error object including failure list and applied list like applySubFiles.

- fileIdObjs is calculated the same as in applySubFiles(fileIdObjs) with the exception that each entry of fileIdObjs has an extra property "offset" which is a signed number. offset is the same in every entry.

there should be an input box labeled Trim to the left of the FileId input box the same width as the FileId input box.  The value in the Trim input box must be a signed integer.

when a value is accepted from the Trim input box bring up a confirmation that says "Is it ok to adjust timing by <ms> ms?" where <ms> is the number from the Trim input box.

if confirmed then call offsetSubfiles(fileIdObjs) with the property "offset" in every fileIdObjs entry with the number from the Trim input box.

show errors like "Error: unknownfunction: offsetSubfiles" in the middle of the top row for 2 secs.
