## in /downloads api call if forceDownload:true is not an arg then do the following:

 - after you load the torrent file extract the file title list.  send that list to tv-proc server using a new api call in tv-proc module. it is called with POST http://localhost:3003/checkFiles with JSON body ["Title1", "Title2"].

 - tv-proc will look to see if any of those file titles have already been downloaded.  it will return a list of titles ["Title1", "Title2"] already downloaded. 

- if the returned list is not empty then do not send torrent to qbt. 

- in any case pass the tv-proc returned list as the result of the /downloads call.
