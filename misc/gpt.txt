- add the line
"======================================================" 
to tv.log, with a blank line before, every time a cycle starts its first download.  it should appear before other log lines for that download. the groups have a blank line before alo so there won't be two blank lines together.

- assign a sequence number to each download when starting and change beginning of first line of a group from "[<worker num>]" to [<seq num>.<worker num>]". this means the start group and finish group of each download will have the same sequence number. the sequence number starts at 1 on startup and never resets.

-change number of leading spaces in second line of groups so the left side of date on the first line aligns with left side of size on second line
