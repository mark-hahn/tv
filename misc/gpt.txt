don't monitor addDir or add file events.  only handle unlink, move, or rename events. tvResync should only  delete entries.

we should only delete finished or errored tv.sqlite entries.

whenever an entry changes to finished or errored then check the local file path and delete the entry if file is missing - in other words let progress complete before checking for deletion.
