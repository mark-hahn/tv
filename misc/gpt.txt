in all modes:
  add new components actors.vue and component actor.vue.

  actors.vue should be a pane the same size as series and map panes.

  add actors.vue to the rotation of panes to show when clicking in one of the panes.

  it should use the array characters in tvDbData. call each entry an actor.

  for each actor add the component actor.vue to actors.vue by wrapping. 

  the actor.vue pane should contain the image from the tvDb.image url with the caption of tvDb.actor.


give me a function that finds the characters in tvdb json results like black-rabbit.json. It should return an array of character objects that include properties 

name, personName, image, personImgURL, url, sort, isFeatured, 

only include characters with peopleType of Actor
