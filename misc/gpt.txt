the show Coupling has a map pane table that shows a total of 28 episodes. all 28 have files and all 28 are watched, but the series pane infobox says "Watched 29 of 30".

the problem is that two of the files in the local disk have the name (title): 
"Coupling.S04.EXTRA.From.Screen.to.Script.PAL.DVD.AC3.x264-SDB.mkv"
and
"Coupling.S04.EXTRA.Outtakes.PAL.DVD.AC3.x264-SDB.mkv"

S04.EXTRA is obviously a parsing problem but the map and infobox should at least match.  

ideally S04.EXTRA would parse as Season 4, Episode 0, but let's concentrate on the mismatch for now

in needed add logging.


- log what parse-torrent-title returns for the file titles with EXTRA

- watched counts in infobox are now correct, but the next up line has "Next Up S04 Eundefined".  the next up line should not be there since there are no un-watched shows.  so watched line was fixed but not next up
