instructions on what torrents should be reuturned from searchTorrents and in what order follow:

if a torrent has no parsed.episode value then the torrent is a season torrent. 

if torrent has a parsed.episode value then the torrent is an episode torrent.  

 if it is a season torrent then it should only be returned if S<parsed.season value> is in needed array. <parsed.season value> is padded to two digits.

 if it is an episode torrent then it should only be returned if S<parsed.season value>E<parsed.episode value> is in needed array. <parsed.season value> and <parsed.episode value> are padded to two digits.

if parsed.resolution is present and value does not contain "1080" or "720" then don't return.

torrents should be sorted with season torrents first and episode torrents second.

torrents with parsed.resolution that contain "1080" should be sorted before parsed.resolution that contain "720"

torrents that contain parsed.bitdepth value of 10 should be sorted before ones that dont.

if an entry in needed array did not match any torrent then a dummy torrent containing just {"notorrent": <entry>} should be added to results at the end
