i am still only talking about simpleMode turned on.

the state of the filter and collections buttons will control what shows are in the shows list by setting conds on and off.
the old cond buttons are not shown. 

cond states are off except for when a filter button in buttons.vue is on. each of the fltr and collections buttons sets the cond of the same name.
