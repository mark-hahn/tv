there is a show "Can You Keep a Secret?" that has listings in the ipTorrents website and in the flexget history but tor api can't find it.  dump all data from torrent search in tor pane into misc/temp.txt for debugging
.

for debugging change request in tor to remove ? . in /api/search?show=Can%20You%20Keep%20a%20Secret&limit=1000&needed=%5B%22force%22%5D instead of /api/search?show=Can%20You%20Keep%20a%20Secret%3F&limit=1000&needed=%5B%22force%22%5D

in the IpTorrents website search for "Can You Keep a Secret" i get:

Can You Keep a Secret S01E01 1080p iP WEB-DL AAC2 0 H 264-RAWR

the temp.txt debug dump doesn't have RAWR in the text.  what happened to "Can You Keep a Secret S01E01 1080p iP WEB-DL AAC2 0 H 264-RAWR"? is there something in the query to block it?

the original search with the ? returned only one result and removing the ? gave many more results.  we should remove any non-alphanumeric characters before search.

query IPT with category “All” and any other changes you can think of to make the query more lenient. don't remove any filtering after the query like excludedStrings.

make these changes now and we'll remove debugging later
