in the reel pane whenever curTvdb gets set at loading, or later, call srvr.getRemotesCmd(params) where params is an object with the properties show,  tvdbRemotes, and fast.

- show property value  is:  
{
  "Name": "<name>",
  "TvdbId": "<tvdb_id>",   
}
where <name> is curTvdb.name and <tvdb_id> is curTvdb.tvdb_id

- tvdbRemotes property value is curTvdb.remote_ids

- fast property value is true

when srvr.getRemotesCmd() returns results the results should be stored in reel.vue var getRemotesResults.

getRemotesResults looks like:
[
  {
    "name": "Google",
    "url": "<googleUrl>"
  },
  {
    "name": "<imdbName>",
    "url": "<imdbUrl>"
  }
]
the object with the name "Google" we will call the googleResult.

the object with a name that starts with "IMDB" we will call the imdbResult. a sample of <imdbName> in imdbResult is "IMDB (7.5)".

either googleResult or imdbResult could be missing. there may be other objects and properties that can be ignored. 

if srvr.getRemotesCmd() returns and we have no googleResult then hide the google button in #reelButtons. 

the google button should have the action of creating a browser tab with the url <googleUrl>.

if srvr.getRemotesCmd() returns and we have no imdbResult then hide the imdb button in #reelButtons.

if we do have an imdbResult then change the name of the Imdb button to <imdbName>.

the imdb button should have the action of creating a browser tab with the url <imdbUrl>.
