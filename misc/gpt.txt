i removed everything related to torrents. Now torrents are found by web client and processed here.  I've enclosed instructions about torrents from client project copilot.  they are in misc/srvr-instr.md.  study them.

add setTorrents and getTorrent commands to index.js like     case 'getNewTvdb':    tvdb.getNewTvdb(   id, param, resolve, reject); break;

then create file src/torrents.js. it will handle setTorrents and getTorrent commands

src/torrents.js will have  handler functions that just respond for testing.

for setTorrents  return torrents received from client back to client with id added.

for getTorrent just log data received and return the same data.
