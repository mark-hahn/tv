toggling some buttons changes the state of some other buttons.

In each click the clicked button is toggled independent of any other toggle instructions.

there are button interactions. the format of each interaction is buttonName:on/off:otherButtons:noChange/on/off

for now we will just add one action 

show all:on:filter group:off

next interaction is: 

order group:on:other order buttons:off

order button that is on:off:order group:off
