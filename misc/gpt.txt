=== copilot should ignore this file 
=== do not use this file for prompts
=== it is just a scratchpad for editing copilot prompts.

## in main.js:

- remove requestStartProc, only startProc will be used.

- remove show title as arg of startProc. there will be no args.

- remove the prioritizing of a show title feature and remove all related code. 

## when startProc is called do the same as before when arg was blank:

- if a cycle is running, restart after the current file finishes
- if nothing is running, start a new cycle immediately
