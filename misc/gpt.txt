add a line at the top of the reelInfo box with the selected card title in reelGallery

change the font-size of that title to 12px and truncate the title instead of wrapping

set #reelDescr height to 120

adjust top of reelTitles pane to bottom of buttons pane

after reelTitles pane mounted scroll to bottom

i meant after it was populated

change image width in gallery to 101px centered horizontally in card

remove margin-bottom from #reelInfo

remove Prev button -- 
when the Load button is clicked perform the same action that happens when a card in the #searchList is clicked using the selected card in the gallery

the Load button action does not match clicking a card in #searchList.  

when clicking in card in the #searchList a dialog appears saying web data is being loaded and then the show appears in the list view and the series pane shows with all the data visible.  

the Load button just brought up an empty series pane. nothing was loaded from the web.

when next is clicked and titles are appended to the titles pane and the bottom pane of the title pane is automatically selected -- then that selection should set srchStr just like clicking on a titles pane.  if srchStr in gallery already matches the title in the titles card the gallery should ignore it.

the titles pane is not populated by mounting or by click of next button

when i go from reel pane to series pane and back the reel pane changes.  it should do nothing and stay the same because it is using v-show and the only automatic change is when mounted

in reelgood.js ignore titles that are already in resultTitles just like ones in oldShows. you will need to parse the resultTitles string to get the real title after |

why do you need to build a set of titles already present in resultTitles

when getReel returns and empty array add a msg titles card that says "-- no more titles --.
later, if something is appended to the list remove that msg titles card 

when srch title changes and the gallery loads new cards it should scroll to the top and select the top card

when getReel returns and empty array scroll titles list to bottom whether a msg titles card alreay exists or not. if adding a msg titles card scroll to bottom after it was added.
