Put a tabbed pane div to the right of the list div, in the location where there is currently the series pane, map pane, etc. 

refactor the series pane, map pane, etc. into the contents of the tabs.

This is a list of the tabs and which current pane should become the contents. The format is a list of <tab name>:<old pane name>.

Series:series, 
Map:map, 
Actors:actors,
Tor:torrents,
Down:status,
Qbt:history,
Proc:tvproc

Remove all buttons that switched the old panes. The pane switching should be replaced by the tab switching. 

Pane/tab contents other than those buttons should be unchanged from the old pane.

Any automatic pane switching should stay the same.  an example is switching to the series tab when a show selection changes.



add a new file flex.vue -- it should show a pane like the series pane, map pane, etc.

it should have a sticky hdr with 2 lines.

The top line should have "Flexget" on top left and buttons on the right.  buttons should be Torrents, Status, History, TvProc, Series, and Map
