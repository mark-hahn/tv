in the status pane start calling the qbt api the first time the pane is visible. Then keep calling all the time, even when the pane is not visible.

When the status pane is hidden the gap between the calls should be 10 secs. When the status pane is visible use a gap between the calls of 1 sec. 

Since the pane is displayed with v-show, the pane display should keep updating even when the pane is not visible. 

This way while the pane is not visible, torrents that were received and then not received will show when the pane is later visible.
