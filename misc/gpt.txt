add a function to src/tvdb.js called getEpisode that is passed show name, series number, and episode number.  it should return all the episode data from tvdb.com about that episode. 

for testing, add code to app.vue onmounted that calls getEpisode with ("Mom", 1, 1) and logs the result


add src/components/episode.vue.  it should be a pane that is the exact same size and position as the Series, Map, Actors, and Torrents panes and positioned in app.vue with the others.

add an Episodes button to the series pane remote buttons list at the beginning.  When clicked it should display the episode pane.

display the show name at top left of pane the same as in the Series, Map, Actors, and Torrents panes
