add a line at the top of the reelInfo box with the selected card title in reelGallery

change the font-size of that title to 12px and truncate the title instead of wrapping

set #reelDescr height to 120

adjust top of reelTitles pane to bottom of buttons pane

after reelTitles pane mounted scroll to bottom

i meant after it was populated

change image width in gallery to 101px centered horizontally in card

remove margin-bottom from #reelInfo

remove Prev button -- 
when the Load button is clicked perform the same action that happens when a card in the #searchList is clicked using the selected card in the gallery

the Load button action does not match clicking a card in #searchList.  

when clicking in card in the #searchList a dialog appears saying web data is being loaded and then the show appears in the list view and the series pane shows with all the data visible.  

the Load button just brought up an empty series pane. nothing was loaded from the web.
