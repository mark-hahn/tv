add to the app a new component file src/components/flex.vue. it should show a pane in a tab like the series tab, map tab, etc.

The tab should be named "Flex" and it should be between Tor and Down.

the pane should be layed out like the qbt history pane and behave like it. The header should just say Flexget History. The scrolling pane should have cards.

there should be a new endpoint in torrents/src/server.js called flexget(). when called it should execute an ssh command to the usb server with the bash command "flexget history". 

the usb server details are in torrents/cookies/qbt-cred.txt.

the flex tab pane should call flexget() every 10 seconds only when the pane is visible.

the returned text will have groups of 5 lines separated by lines that only contain spaces and vertical bars |.  each group provides the data for one card. 

the group format, ignoring white space, is:
│Task│<provider>│
│Title│<title>│
│URL│<url>│
│Time|<time>|
│Details│Accepted by series (reason: <reason>)|

Put <title> in the first row of the card.  In the second row list these values separated by commas in this format:
<provider>, <time>, <reason>

convert the <time> value from format "Tue Dec 16 05:25:08 2025" to "<month>/<day> <hour>:<mins>" with no leading zero on month or day.  hour and mins should be two digits.


you said "That output means the USB box really doesn’t have any runnable flexget executable for user xobtlu (not in PATH, not in ~/.local/bin, not in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin, and no Python “scripts” install that pr" but that is impossible -- 

when i use ssh in a termin and type in the "flexget history" bash command  in the server it works

usb(~) flexget history
There is a FlexGet process already running for this config, sending execution there.
