- create new pane in #tabbody with tab named File.

- it should call a server endpoint getFile(<path>) to get file listings from server disk. The return value should have this object format: 
{
  [
    "<child1 file name>",
    "<child2 dir name>": [
      "<child21 file name>",
      "<child22 file name>"
    ]
  ]
where the outer array is the children of <path> arg.

- It should have a sticky hdr with an input box and Open button on the right. the input box width should span the whole pane except for the width of the button. a return keypress inside the input or Open button click should call getFile(<input box>).  

- The return object should be displayed in a scroll pane where the the dirs and file are shown in tree with each dir node collapsable.

- the pane should open with the selected show file path in the input box. when a show selection changes the input box path and tree should change to match the new file.

- clicking anywhere on a dir name should toggle the node.

- clicking on a file name should put the file path including file name in the clipboard.

- the text in the input box should be aligned to the right when a value is inserted.
