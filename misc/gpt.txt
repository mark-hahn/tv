there are many image urls in this tvdb.com json data black-rabbit.json with key "Image".  

The first one at response/image is: "https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/series/447579/posters/68d2d5dd76d43.jpg". it is the main one I have been using for the series pane. it has foreign non-english text in image. Which image has english text and how do you knw which one it is?
