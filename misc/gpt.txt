remove all logging except:
 
 name of show loading.
 if guests show season num and episode num
 lengths of both lists before merge.
 number of duplicates removed.
 total count of output.
 how many output are from tvdb and how many from tmdb.

============================================================

Actors without images should be sorted last in output no mattter what group they are in.  it is higher priority than tvdb vs. tmdb

============================================================

regulars for a show are always loaded before guests.  remember regulars and when guests are loaded remove regulars from both initial guest lists before merge -- clear everythin when a show selection changes

============================================================

remove logging except for one line containing show name, season/episode (S01E01) if episode, how many output are from tvdb, and how many from tmdb.
