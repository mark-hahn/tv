in the season list and the episode list make sure seasons listed match those in map and make sure episodes listed match those in map

- make sure season list has a card for every season in series map and for missing ones show: "Season <season number> missing", in light-red.

- make sure season list has a card for every season in series map and for missing ones show: "Season <season number> subs missing", in light-red.

- make sure episode list has a card for every episode in map and for missing ones show: "SxxYxx subs missing", in  light-red.

the show Toast of London has 50 subs according to website search 
- count at top of search page shows 580/776
- the total number of episodes in season list is 19

i found the numbers problem - the subs pane was showing an old show selection.  i switched shows by using filtering down to one show.  subs was still using the show from before filtering.

that worked --
