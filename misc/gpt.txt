df on the host server says:

srvr(~) df
Filesystem                         1K-blocks       Used  Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1                         9689313060 7398198696 2291097980  77% /mnt/m-bkup
/dev/sdb1                         9688268580 7368362056 1831570040  81% /mnt/media

but the second row in the table says:
SRVR 34 GB 65%


- reformat the table into two tables with one row and two columns each.
- put the tables in one line with USB on left and SRVR on right with 50px space between them
- shrink the space between the show title line and this line
 - make the sticky hdr just tall enough so there is 10px between the tables line and the botton of the hdr

 put the two tables in one div that spans the full width of the pane. put the div below the show name and buttons

 - undo that
 - the problem i was trying to fix is that the vertical position of the two tables don't align. the USB table is higher than the SRVR.   fix that.
 - set the space between the tables to 25px
