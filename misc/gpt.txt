in torrents.vue after downloading is approved call getQbtInfo({filter: 'downloading'}) repeatedly with 1 sec between the result of one call and the start of the next. 

the state of the call results should be shown live above the top torrent card until the torrents pane is closed.

there will be no torrent in the results until downloading is started. before the first torrent arrives the state should just be a msg "Waiting for download to start ..."

when a torrent is received start displaying the state as a list of torrent properties and their values with the property names lined up in the left of each line and the values lined up with the first char of each value starting 2 char positions after the longest prop name like:
foo:       "a result"
foobarbaz: 27
foobar:    -1

when a result with no torrent is received after showing a list of torrent properties then stop calling getQbtInfo and leave the last list of torrent properties showing.

the properties to show are in this list.  

properties labelled as date should be converted to time hh:mm:ss in pacific time zone.

properties labelled as size should be converted to human size like 11.1 GB.

properties labelled as speed should be converted to integer mbits/sec like 782 mbits/sec.

properties labelled as duration should be converted from secs to mm:ss mins

properties labelled as string or integer should be shown as is.

properties labelled as percent should be shown as integer xx%

the value shown for eta should be computed as (base time (epoc) + property eta (secs)) and formatted in Pacific time hh:mm:ss where Base time is last_activity when present (fallbacks: seen_complete, added_on, completion_on).

properties are ...
name (string),

size (size), 
downloaded (size), 

state  (string),
trackers_count (integer),
num_seeds (integer),
dlspeed (speed),

amount_left (size),
