Torrents, Status, History, Series, and Map

keep a history in the torrent of every torrent downloaded in past 60 days.  use the hash to identify the torrent. show a clock icon in card when downloaded before
--
do not change current check mark icon or its meaning

add a new file history.vue -- it should show a pane like the series pane, map pane, etc.


past download clock icon isn't showing. the localstorage has no entry for this.
--
show download clock icon in search card immediately when download finishes
--
change download confirmation msg in dialog to "Is it OK to download file <torrent title>?"
--
remove mins label string from info pane

when using ssh to run du on seed box, i'm sometimes getting: spaceAvail: unexpected ssh du output:
spaceAvail: ssh du failed (unparsable stdout): Error: Command failed: ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=10 -o LogLevel=ERROR -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null xobtlu@oracle.usbx.me cd; du -s

 -- it says sigterm, doesn't that mean someone told it to stop
