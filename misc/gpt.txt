i undid that - i gave bad instructions -- here are new instructions --

add 2 new commands to srvr.js send to remote server not on laptop. each should look like export function updateTvdb() {return fCall('updateTvdb')}

one is called setTorrents and the other is getTorrent.

when torrents are loaded in torrents.vue don't show them immediately.  send all torrent data to the server with setTorrents command.  

setTorrents will return a new list with a subset of the torrents meant to be displayed in order received.

each torrent received will have a field called torrentId.

when torrent card is clicked call getTorrent with torrentId.  

if result of either command has json field "error":<message> then show the error message in torrents pane.

both commands will expect and return json data

i got No torrents found when i should have gotten error from srvr.  here is console: 22:45:24.716 [vite] connected from window 5ba443f8-38a6-4ece-a2cf-06a357e521c1:67:11
