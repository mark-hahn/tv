how do you get the tracker url for a torrent from the qbttorrent server api 

how does the code get the title for this tv.json object when the object is created:

  "title": "its.always.sunny.in.philadelphia.s17e02.1080p.web.h264-successfulcrab.mkv",
  "status": "finished",
  "progress": 100,
  "eta": null,
  "sequence": 2,
  "fileSize": 1181367768,
  "season": 17,
  "episode": 2,
  "dateStarted": 1766961646,
  "dateEnded": 1766961749
}

write an explanation of tv.json in misc/tv-json-doc.md.  explain the flow of data in and out of the tv.json cache, the meaning of the fields, how duplicates are handled, how progress is updated, and when it is flushed.
