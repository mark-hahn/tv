the client claims this is all it got:
{
  "show": "Due South",
  "count": 0,
  "torrents": [],
  "rawProviderCounts": {
    "TorrentLeech": 1
  }
}
the 480 filter did not show in those results:


{
  "show": "Due South",
  "needed": [
    "force"
  ],
  "url": "https://hahnca.com/torrents-api/api/search?show=Due%20South&limit=1000&needed=%5B%22force%22%5D",
  "apiCount": 0,
  "torrentsReturned": 0,
  "rawProviderCounts": {
    "TorrentLeech": 1
  },
  "sample": []
}
