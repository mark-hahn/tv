i stopped the app in the middle of downloading and then restarted it.  The entries that were downloading correctly started over.  But there was one future entry and it was added a second time by the cycle even though it was already in tv.json.

after usb file list is downloaded also read tv.json and block any files where the title is already in tv.json. tv.json should not be cached.

so now the list of files read after usb file list is downloaded is data/tv-errors.json, data/tv-finished.json, data/tv-inProgress.json, and data/tv.json. any file in any of the files should be blocked.  none should be cached.
