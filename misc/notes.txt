Server changes needed (Web add -> put series in Emby)

Client changes were made so that when adding a new series from the web-search list it will:
- call a websocket RPC: createShowFolder({ showName, tvdbId, seriesMapSeasons, tvdbData })
- request an Emby library refresh and poll task status
- reload shows and use the real Emby show record if it appears

IMPORTANT: the client only calls createShowFolder when it has map data (tvdbData is present and non-empty).
If tvdbData is missing/empty, it shows an alert and skips folder creation.

What the server must implement

1) Add a websocket RPC handler named: createShowFolder

Signature / behavior (recommended)
- Input: an object (JSON) like:
	{ showName: string, tvdbId?: number|string, seriesMapSeasons?: number[], tvdbData?: object }
- Action:
	1) Create the show folder under the TV root (e.g. /mnt/media/tv/<showName>)
	2) If seriesMapSeasons is provided, also create empty season folders inside it
	   (e.g. Season 01, Season 02, ...)
- Idempotent: if the folder already exists, return ok
- Return: something JSON-serializable like:
	{ ok: true, created: true|false, path: "..." }
	or just "ok" (client only cares that it resolves)

Implementation notes
- Sanitize showName to a safe folder name. Minimum: reject empty string, strip trailing dots/spaces, and remove path separators (/ and \\) to prevent traversal.
- Season folder naming should match your existing on-disk conventions (common patterns: "Season 01" or "Season 1").
- Use mkdir with recursive/parents enabled.
- Do NOT delete/overwrite existing data.

Where to add it

The client websocket wrapper was added in src/srvr.js:
	export function createShowFolder(params) { return fCall('createShowFolder', params) }

So the websocket server behind wss://hahnca.com/tv-series-srvr must route incoming fname === 'createShowFolder'
to the implementation described above.

If you use a dispatcher like the one in misc/index.js (switch(fname) { ... }), add:
	case 'createShowFolder': createShowFolder(id, param, resolve, reject); break;

and implement createShowFolder similar to:
	- parse param as JSON object
	- compute path = tvDir + '/' + safeName
	- fs.mkdir(path, { recursive: true })
	- for each season in seriesMapSeasons: fs.mkdir(path + '/' + seasonFolderName(season), { recursive:true })
	- resolve([id, { ok:true, created:true|false, path }])

2) Emby side

Nothing special is required server-side for Emby if Emby is already configured to monitor that TV root.
After the folder exists, the client triggers a library refresh and waits for it to finish.
