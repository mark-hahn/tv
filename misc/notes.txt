- change the "status":"future" used in tv.json to "status":"waiting" and change all code that looks for "status":"future" to look for "status":"waiting"

- a worker should calculate download speed in bits/sec and update its tv.json entry to have a speed field with that number every time it updates progress and eta.  use the old method of calculating speed and if you don't remember it I will revert the commits to find it.
