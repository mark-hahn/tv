tv-proc changes (re-applied; misc/gpt.txt untouched)

- tv.json cache in src/tvJson.js is now a Map keyed by title; disk format remains a JSON array.
- data/tv-errors.json is removed; errors are stored as `error: true` on tv.json entries.
- One-time migration on startup: if data/tv-errors.json exists, matching tv.json titles are marked `error:true` and the file is deleted (mismatches ignored).
- /downloads now returns the most recent 200 tv.json entries as a JSON list sorted by procId (ascending).
- tv.json flush happens on: addEntry, worker finished/error, and after pruneMissingUsbDirs removes entries.
- Pruning of deleted USB folders is run hourly inside the existing delOldFiles hourly prune block (old USB prune first, then tv.json prune). No separate timer was added.
- Removed legacy time-based tv.json pruning (30-day cutoff).
