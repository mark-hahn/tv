1
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,542
Hello? Excuse me?
There's a line, buddy.

2
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:11,701
There's two lines.

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,177
No, no, there's one line.
We're in it.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,009
I'm just getting
a hot dog.

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,515
We're all getting hot dogs.

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:18,982
What, do you think
there's two lines

7
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,450
and we're all in this line

8
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:21,884
and you're the only genius
that got in the other line?

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,081
You believe this guy?

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,388
Don't line up behind him.
He cheated you.

11
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,395
Hey, shut up.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,226
Now I want all the hot dogs,
please.

13
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,629
Yeah,
I'm buying all the hot dogs.

14
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:34,665
You don't have to do that.

15
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,201
No, no, no,
You don't have to do that.

16
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,234
That is ridiculous.

17
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,601
And I'm giving them
to the good people.

18
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,798
I'm starving.

00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:44,138

That's Pam,

34
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,838
The Overly-Confident
Morbidly Obese Woman.

35
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,708
This fat suit
smells like corn chips.

36
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,873
<i>Going again,
please. Thank you.</i>

37
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,212
And this is the set
of "The Girlie Show."

38
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,151
It's a real fun ladies'
comedy show for ladies.

39
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,812
Hey, everybody, look.

40
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,515
Here's someone you never
get a chance to meet.

41
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,650
It's the head writer
of "The Girlie Show," Liz Lemon.

42
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,196
Hey.
What's up?

43
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,239
Hey, have you looked
at that cat-lady sketch?

44
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,568
It's still
seven minutes long.

45
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,573
Yikes, okay.

46
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,075
Oh, and Standards
has a problem

47
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,405
with that
Michael Jackson bit.

48
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,410
Why?

49
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,140
Apparently,
you can't say he's got a vagina.

50
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,239
Ohh! Fine, I'll just
take the whole thing out.

51
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,079
Hey, you've got to tell
that NBC page

52
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,243
to take it down a notch.

53
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,251
Who, Kenneth?

54
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,912
He just embarrassed me
in front of a whole tour group.

55
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,081
I'll talk to him.
What is this?

56
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,250
Well, you know how I hate it
when people cheat

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,349
or break rules?

58
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,519
Yes, I do.

59
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,392
Well, I just spent 150 bucks
on wieners.

60
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,556
Attaboy.

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,595
Chumley, the beverage situation
around here

62
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,897
is reprehensible.

63
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,733
Oh, good morning,
sunshine.

64
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,204
Surely,
our massive conglomerate

65
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,073
parent company could spring
for a samovar of coffee.

66
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,045
Yeah, or, like,
a big coffee dispenser.

67
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,809
That's what a samovar is.

68
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,374
Are there other black nerds,
or is it just you and Urkel?

69
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,216
Uh, Cerie, do you want to
go get some coffee?

70
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,347
No, thank you.

71
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,857
No?

72
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,723
Hey, Josh, I need to change
your Michael Jackson thing.

73
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,024
Didn't you tell me
you had a Jay Leno impression?

74
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,564
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
check it out.

75
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,497
So, President Bush

76
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,000
is in the news again.

77
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,435
<i>No, Jay Leno.</i>

78
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,904
The host
of "The Tonight Show."

79
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,440
That's what I was doing.

80
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,100
So, my wife Mavis and I

81
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,269
like to go shopping
for old cars, you know?

82
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,438
No, no, like Jay Leno.

83
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,880
Like,
"Hey, here are the headlines."

84
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,211
Have you ever noticed

85
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,047
when you eat
a lot of cheese...

86
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,121
How is that different
from what I was doing?

87
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,816
And I don't think you need to
introduce the writers

88
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,153
to the tour group.

89
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,385
I agree.

90
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,893
I thought
they would find it interesting,

91
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,053
but they really did not.

92
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,597
Well, Kenneth,
just respect their privacy.

93
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,291
I promise
I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger.

94
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,368
I'm sure you will.

95
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,026
I just...

96
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,866
I just love television
so much.

97
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,701
We all do.

98
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,106
Liz, they want you and Pete
on the 50th floor.

99
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,543
Who, Gary? All right, tell him
I'll be up in half an hour.

100
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,204
No, they said now.

101
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,215
If they've got cookies up there,
grab some.

102
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,251
Ooh, and get them to pay
for my samovar.

103
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,320
Of course. I assume
that's what we're meeting about.

104
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,083
What about Ray Romano?
Can you do Ray?

105
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,954
Hey, aah, ho, Debra.

106
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,254
There you go.

107
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,885
My brother's tall!

108
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,623
Right?

109
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,993
Are we in trouble
or something?

110
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,657
No way.
Gary loves the show.

111
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,997
Pleased with the ratings.

112
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,664
Right, of course.
They love us.

113
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,306
Where's Gary?

114
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,506
Gary's dead.

115
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,481
I'm Jack Donaghy,

116
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,519
new VP of Development
for NBC-GE-Universal-Kmart.

117
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,952
We own Kmart now?

118
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:16,953
No.

119
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,422
So, why are you dressed
like we do?

120
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,427
I'm surprised you're renovating.
This is such a nice office.

121
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,931
It's a great office,
but sometimes, you have to

122
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,797
change things
that are perfectly good

123
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,961
just to make them your own.

124
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,699
Please.

125
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,741
Uh, I'll call her back.

126
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,708
Is she at
the White House line? Great.

127
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,178
Tell them I need
a 4:00 A. M. tee-off time.

128
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,945
Uh, 5 inches,
but it's thick.

129
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,979
Are you familiar
with the GE trivection oven?

130
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,489
I don't cook very much.

131
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,651
Sure. I got you.

132
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,288
New York third-wave feminist,
college-educated,

133
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,956
single and pretending to be
happy about it,

134
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,431
overscheduled, undersexed.

135
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,558
You buy any magazine

136
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,796
that says "healthy body image"
on the cover.

137
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:09,705
And every two years,
you take up knitting for...

138
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,707
a week.

139
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,641
That is dead-on!

140
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,372
What, are you gonna
guess my weight now?

141
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,004
You don't want me
to do that.

142
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,811
That knitting thing is uncanny.
How do you do that?

143
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,476
Market research, my friend.

144
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,645
Years and years
of market research

145
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,885
which led to my greatest
triumph... the trivection oven.

146
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,326
Oh. My wife
wants one of those.

147
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,829
Can we get Pete an oven,
please?

148
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,398
The GE trivection oven

149
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,932
cooks perfect food
five times faster

150
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,399
than a conventional oven

151
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,662
because it uses
three kinds of heat...

152
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,102
thermal technology
for consistent temperature,

153
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,140
GE precise
air-convection technology

154
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,674
for optimal
air circulation,

155
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,337
and microwave technology
for incredible speed.

156
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,349
With three kinds of heat,
you can cook a turkey...

157
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,681
in 22 minutes.

158
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,346
Wow.
That is impressive.

159
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,186
The people upstairs think so.
That's why they promoted me.

160
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,692
That's why they sent me here
to retool your show.

161
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,853
Retool what, now?

162
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,022
I'm the new Vice President
of east-coast television

163
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,895
and microwave-oven
programming.

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,969
That sounds like
you program microwave ovens.

165
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,834
I like you.

166
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,807
You have the boldness
of a much-younger woman.

167
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,740
Lee, does my face
look bloated to you?

168
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,411
When I played that lady rapist
on "Law & Order,"

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,750
guess what the makeup guy
put on under my eyes

170
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,255
to take the puffiness out.

171
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,881
Hemorrhoid cream.

172
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,097
Miss Maroney, I have
the cat wrangler here for you.

173
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,895
Oh, is it
that horrible little... Hi.

174
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,062
Hey. Greta Johanssen...
short for Lugreta.

175
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,230
Hi. Great
to see you again.

176
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,238
You too.

177
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,070
I'm here to introduce you
to the feline actors

178
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,404
you're gonna be
working with tonight.

179
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,274
Okay.
This is Poppo.

180
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,437
And this here
is Captain Boots.

181
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,445
Hello.

182
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,675
Would you describe yourself
as cat-competent?

183
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,752
Oh, yes.
I love cats.

184
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:00,910
I used to have two cats.

185
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,920
But then I moved to this place
with hardwood floors,

186
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,614
so we had to
put them down.

187
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,125
I'm joking.

188
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,787
We've done several focus groups
on the show,

189
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,194
and what I've gleaned...

190
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,131
the blond,
big-eyed girl is popular

191
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,361
with women and older gays.

192
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,732
Jenna.
That's my friend Jenna.

193
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,398
And the kid with the funny hair
is liked by women,

194
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:25,671
but you're missing men
between 18 and 49.

195
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,803
I'm not missing them.
They're just not there.

196
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,711
I think I can fix that.

197
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,910
So, your job is you take things
that are already working,

198
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,986
and you fix them.

199
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,111
That's a great job.

200
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,689
Why don't we, uh...

201
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,883
You're missing
that third kind of heat.

202
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,187
I want you to think
about Tracy Jordan.

203
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,819
Okay, the black guy?

204
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,988
The black movie star.

205
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,497
I flew with him on a private jet
to the Super Bowl recently,

206
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,999
and I found him
very entertaining.

207
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,662
Isn't he, um... crazy?

208
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,240
Tracy's had his problems
in the last few years.

209
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,434
I am a Jedi!

210
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,443
I am a Jedi!

211
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,877
I am a Jedi!

212
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,243
The important thing
to remember is

213
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,374
he was never charged
with a crime.

214
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,419
It's not illegal to fall asleep
on your neighbor's roof.

215
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,215
Nor should it be.

216
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,314
Tracy Jordan
is the third heat.

217
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,484
I don't know where we're gonna
find room in the budget

218
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,891
for a guy
like Tracy Jordan.

219
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,519
I think I do.

220
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,567
What are you doing?

221
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,101
Sometimes,
when I have these stress dreams,

222
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,934
if I go to sleep in the dream,
I come out of it.

223
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,735
"This is not a dream."

224
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,936
Tracy Jordan
is in New York today, Liz.

225
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,910
I'd like you
to have lunch with him.

226
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,948
We have a show tonight,
Mr. Donaghy.

227
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,607
I don't know
if your research covered this,

228
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,278
but we do a dress rehearsal
and then a live show.

229
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,617
That's tonight.
This is lunch.

230
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,623
If it's not a good fit,
I'll drop the whole thing.

231
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,990
If I meet with Tracy Jordan
and we mutually agree

232
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,553
that this is the worst idea
ever, you'll back off?

233
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,098
I'm known
for being reasonable.

234
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,868
Okay.

235
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,199
Alfredo, 2:00 P. M.

236
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,864
I'm not dressed
for that.

237
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,408
You're dressed for Burger King.
Should we make it Burger King?

238
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,808
Pete,
hang back for me.

239
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,313
Yeah, you bet.

240
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,617
<i>Y'all, please set yourselves
for "Dr. Ridiculous."</i>

241
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,689
Hey.

242
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,087
What happened
to your head?

243
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,249
The sky is falling.

244
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,259
Do you have a pair
of dress pants or a skirt

245
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,522
or something
I could borrow?

246
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,858
Thank you, Lee.

247
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:26,863
Whatever.

248
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,297
Hey, you know
in that cat-lady sketch,

249
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,629
do I have to hold
a real cat?

250
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,828
Cat-lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.

251
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,997
Oh, good.

252
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,539
Who's that?

253
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,541
That is
the new network dude.

254
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,543
Mmm, yummers.

255
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,045
He reminds me of Scotty
on "General Hospital."

256
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,584
No, ew, Jenna, do not like
that man. That is a bad man.

257
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,744
God, you have a gift.

258
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,650
Laura Bush
is your size.

259
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,198
Excuse me. Hi.
What are you doing down here?

260
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,290
I'm known
for being hands-on.

261
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,299
Clearly.

262
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,393
That's how you should dress
for work, by the way.

263
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,837
Yeah, if I was president
of the Philippines.

264
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,036
Now, Afghanistan
is a different situation.

265
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,371
I'll have an apple juice.

266
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,915
We don't
have apple juice, sir.

267
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,180
Then I'll take
a vodka and tonic.

268
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,085
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon.

269
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,714
I know who you are.

270
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,888
I thought there was a strict
dress code at this place.

271
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,591
I do recommend
the pumpkin ravioli.

272
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,260
They're very subtle.

273
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,033
So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy
wanted me to talk to you

274
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,404
about joining the cast
of our show,

275
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,942
and I don't know
how you feel about that...

276
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,774
Let me ask you a question,
everybody at this table.

277
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,405
Did he just say
the word "pumpkin" to me?

278
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,780
Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli.

279
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:53,783
Yo!

280
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,378
I'm buggin'. I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.

281
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,787
I can't eat here.

282
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,223
I got to go someplace where
they make food that I like.

283
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,859
Lemon, let's go.

284
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,523
I will not work
with Tracy Jordan.

285
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,531
It's just a rumor.

286
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,033
Have you seen
any of his movies?

287
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,036
The guy's sensibility
is just cretinous.

288
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,366
I saw the one
where he plays,

289
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,871
like,
five different characters.

290
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,635
Yeah,
"Black Cop, White Cop."

291
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,073
No.

292
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,075
"Who Dat Ninja"?

293
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,705
No, he... he had to pretend
to be this old lady.

294
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,375
Ooh, ooh, goodness gracious!

295
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,543
You hooligans
better watch out!

296
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,281
'Cause this
honky grandma be trippin'!

297
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,789
Oh, yeah,
that movie was hilarious.

298
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,827
I saw it,
like, five times.

299
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,822
Where's the love?

300
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,527
Right on. Hey,
let me get two half a chickens

301
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,933
and some pecan waffles.

302
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,267
Nothing for me.

303
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,933
I had, like,
four hot dogs this morning.

304
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,737
Eat, Lemon, eat.

305
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,436
I hate skinny women.

306
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,107
Hey, Lana, 10 beers.

307
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,946
So, Tracy,
we should talk about the show.

308
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,282
I ain't doing it unless
I can get to do it my way.

309
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,482
You know, I want it to be raw,
HBO-style content.

310
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,183
Well, it's not HBO.
It's TV.

311
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,193
And I don't think
that it's a good fit.

312
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,354
'Cause I'm gonna
drop truth bombs.

313
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,692
You know
how pissed off I was

314
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,698
<i>when U S Weekly
said that I was on crack?</i>

315
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,530
That's racist.
I'm not on crack.

316
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,297
I'm straight-up
mentally ill.

317
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,599
Sure.

318
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,934
I got
mental-health issues.

319
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,475
Sure. Well, you know,
who doesn't, really?

320
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,509
Hey, has anyone seen Liz?
Or Pete?

321
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,843
She went out.

322
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,383
Well, who's in charge
when they're not here?

323
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,543
I'm in charge.

324
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,085
Oh. Okay.

325
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,486
Um, well,
I'm not sure about this costume.

326
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,888
I think it's hot.

327
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,586
Thank you.
I'm Jenna, by the way.

328
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,664
Miss Maroney, I got
the hemorrhoid cream you wanted.

329
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,393
It's for my face.

330
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,667
Well, wherever you're putting
it, I think it's working.

331
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,403
You know,
I don't think you'd like it,

332
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,741
'cause we work
a lot of hours

333
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,576
and it's live TV,
which is risky.

334
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I like risky.

335
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,909
See, me and you,
we play the game.

336
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,418
We know
how to be acceptable.

337
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,513
"Hello, great meeting.
I drink coffee, please."

338
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,525
This show is our chance
to break the shackles.

339
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,891
'Cause the white dudes
want to see us fail.

340
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,759
What white dudes?

341
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:19,956
All of 'em.

342
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,660
Jack Donaghy, General Electric,
George Bush, Karl Robe.

343
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,997
Karl Robe, you say?

344
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,664
Affirmative action was designed
to keep women and minorities

345
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,832
in competition with each other,
to distract us

346
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,173
while white dudes inject AIDS
into our chicken nuggets.

347
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,008
That's a metaphor.

348
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,342
Sure.

349
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,177
<i>You should tell that

350
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,148
Hey, Lemon,
you like karaoke?

351
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,153
I know a joint.

352
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,986
No, I've got to wrap up
this lunch meeting, Tracy.

353
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,487
I'll take you.
I'll take you.

354
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,566
I just got to make
a quick stop first.

355
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,732
You know what?

356
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,568
When people say
they need to make a quick stop,

357
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,235
they usually mean
at the bank or at the store.

358
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,777
No, thank you.

359
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,643
You know what?
This is for computer classes.

360
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,978
You know why
I should do this TV show, Lemon?

361
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,517
I really don't.

362
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,109
To get you rich.

363
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,746
'Cause you know if I'm on that
TV show, it's gonna blow up.

364
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,449
How do you know
I'm not rich?

365
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,957
Your teeth.

366
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,995
You got to think
like these strippers, Lemon.

367
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,324
They know the window
of opportunity

368
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,659
is only open for a moment.

369
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,164
You got to get in
while you're young,

370
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,734
get the money, and get out.

371
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,564
Yeah, well,
I'm not a sex worker, Tracy.

372
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,001
I don't have sex
for a living.

373
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,299
Neither do we.

374
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,839
Neither do they.

375
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,341
Yes, they do.

376
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,181
Where's my phone?

377
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,882
ß Whoa, whoa, whoa ß

378
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,688
ß Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa ß

379
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:59,230
ß We are strong! ß

380
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:04,064
ß No one can tell us
we're wrong! ß

ß Searching our hearts
for so long! ß

382
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,432
He's got charisma.

383
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:14,103
No, that's Charisma
over there.

384
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,612
"Girlie Show."

385
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,774
Kenneth,
send me a car, okay?

386
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,511
What is your location?

387
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,213
Dark Sensations
in the Bronx.

388
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,914
I wish you were here.

389
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,515
Mr. Donaghy does not get us
showbiz people.

390
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,389
Let me talk to Pete,
okay?

391
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,360
Oh, Pete got fired
this morning.

392
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,556
That's so weird
that you don't know that.

393
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,734
Jack Donaghy thinks

394
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,831
he's gonna come into my house
and mess with my show?!

395
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,240
Hell no!

396
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,904
Jenna and I worked for years
to get this show.

397
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,948
You know,
I moved from Chicago for this.

398
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,948
From Chicago?

399
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,178
I was
in Scottie Pippin's wedding.

400
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,516
Now Donaghy
is trying to steal it from us.

401
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,956
He already fired Pete,
who is a great producer.

402
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,618
Fire Pete?
He can't fire Pete.

403
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,717
You know what?

404
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,626
I quit.
He can suck it.

405
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,291
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, suck it, Pete.

406
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,461
No, you're not listening.
You're not a good listener.

407
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,799
20 minutes to air.

408
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,806
But Liz said we were
cutting the cat-lady sketch.

409
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,136
She said it stinks.
Ouch.

410
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:21,201
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humor is universal.

411
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,871
I just don't think
that I'm good in it.

412
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,244
Do you think
I'm good in it?

413
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,908
I think this is your opportunity
to go out there

414
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,417
and prove everybody wrong.

415
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,077
What? What do you mean?
Who's everybody?

416
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,746
The network
that wanted to fire you,

417
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,585
the focus groups
that said you had a weird eye...

418
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,953
You mean this eye?

419
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,617
Okay, this eye,
it doesn't open all the way

420
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,286
because when I was little,
my sister peed in it.

421
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,795
Tonight is your opportunity
to go out there

422
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,296
and change
all of our minds.

423
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,458
What?!

424
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,468
Where is Liz?!

425
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,265
Liz!

426
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,871
Get down!

427
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,517
<i>Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.</i>

428
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,677
Is Liz back yet?

429
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,153
No. Which cat
do you want Jenna to carry?

430
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,245
I'm sorry?

431
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,257
Which cat?
Oh.

432
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,090
I want... that one.

433
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,427
<i>Jack Donaghy to the forum,
please. Jack Donaghy.</i>

434
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,128
Peanut's not an actor.
I just rescued her from a lab.

435
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:26,473
Hey, Lemon, I'll drop you off.
Where do you live?

436
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,806
The studio.

437
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,312
I want you
to drop me at the studio.

438
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,815
I want to tell Donaghy
to his face that I quit,

439
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,646
and I want to do it
in front of the whole crew

440
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,220
so that they know
he didn't fire me.

441
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,051
I want to see that.

442
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,458
ß It's time
for "The Girlie Show" ß

443
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,997
Oh, oh, pull over!
Pull over here!

444
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,502
Tracy, I don't have time
for this.

445
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,129
Right here.

446
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,234
This is where I grew up.

447
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,379
This is
the Jordan family estate?

448
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,882
Wasn't no Jordan family
nothing.

449
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,179
This is where
I was in foster care.

450
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,152
Oh, sorry.

451
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,190
Me and two other dudes and
a girl with messed-up fingers.

452
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,288
I'm so lucky
I got out of here.

453
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,697
It's not luck.

454
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,528
I mean,
you got out of here

455
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:27,071
because you're very talented
and people love you and...

456
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,605
Are you peeing?

457
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,381
Where's Donaghy?
I want to talk to him right now.

458
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,883
Last time I saw him,
he was riding the crane camera.

459
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,215
Oh, I have Pete for you.

460
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,585
Pete, oh, my God,
I didn't know.

461
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,419
No, hey, listen,
it will give me a chance

462
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,390
to spend more time
with my kids.

463
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,722
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.

464
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:50,726
No, no, no, no, no.

465
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,729
You have the best job in
New York. Don't quit over this.

466
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,355
Don't buy
all the hot dogs, okay?

467
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,026
I don't want to do this
without you.

468
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,730
Hey, I thought
we cut the cat-lady sketch.

469
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,774
We're two minutes short!

470
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:08,274
So, let me introduce myself.

471
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,942
My name is Lurlene Katz.
And these are my cats.

472
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,110
She's using a real cat?

473
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,586
I cast that cat myself.

474
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,419
Why, they are my...
Aah!

475
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,754
Ow!

476
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,054
Oh!

477
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,726
No, no, no, no, he's okay!

478
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,825
I need you to talk
for two minutes.

479
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,460
About what?

480
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,438
Anything.
All right.

481
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,271
These cats are more
than just pets, sir.

482
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,835
Excuse me.
Where's the manager?

483
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,005
I'm from the government,

484
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,845
and I'm here to inspect
your chicken nuggets.

485
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,018
Uh-oh.
Look at shorty.

486
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,855
This honky grandma
be trippin'!

487
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:03,358
What's up, America?!
I'm coming into your house live!

488
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,198
Let me hear you say,
"We love you, Tracy!"

489
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,364
We love you, Tracy!

490
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,203
I am the third heat!

491
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,142
He's brilliant.

492
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,543
Are you drunk?

493
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,212
Yes.

494
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,881
Why did you fire Pete?

495
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,049
Why did you disappear
all night?

496
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,820
Is this some kind of
a power play?

497
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,827
Yeah, yeah,
it's not so fun being hands-on

498
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,624
with these bloodsuckers,
is it?

499
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,062
Can we talk about this
on Monday?

500
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,724
No, I want Pete back.

501
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,564
I want it in writing
that Jenna's job is safe.

502
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,403
And I want a cappuccino machine
for the writers' room.

503
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,566
Fine.

504
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,075
I thought
you were gonna quit.

505
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,146
Yeah, well, you don't know
everything about me.

506
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,511
You weigh 127 pounds.

507
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,914
Yeah.

508
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,682
Oh, yeah!

509
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,225
Holla at your boy!

510
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,993
Hey, you will be hearing
from Peanut's lawyer.

511
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,660
Good night, sleep tight.

512
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,000
I can't wait to do this
with you every week.
