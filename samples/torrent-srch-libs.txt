Yes, there are several libraries across different languages for searching torrents:

Python

    py-torrent-search - Simple interface to multiple torrent sites
    torrench - CLI tool with library functionality for searching torrents
    magnetico - Autonomous torrent search engine (DHT crawler)
    torrent-paradise - Decentralized torrent search

JavaScript/Node.js

    torrent-search-api - Popular library supporting multiple providers
    torrent-indexer - Search across multiple torrent sites
    torrents-search - Another multi-site search library
    kat-cr-search-api - Specific site wrappers (many exist for individual sites)

Go

    go-torrent-search - Multi-provider torrent search
    magnetico - DHT-based autonomous search engine (Go implementation)

Rust

    torrent-search - Async torrent search library
    magnetico-rs - Rust port of magnetico

Ruby

    torrent_api - Multi-site torrent search

PHP

    torrent-rpc - Various torrent-related libraries including search

General Approach

Most of these libraries work similarly:

    Scrape torrent site HTML/JSON
    Parse results into standardized format (name, size, seeds, magnet link)
    Provide unified API across multiple sites

The challenge with all of them is maintenance - torrent sites frequently change their layouts or go offline, so these libraries require constant updates. Many GitHub repos for these tools are abandoned or sporadically maintained.

For production use, you might want to check which ones are actively maintained before choosing.
